Read and follow the instructions in the CLAUDE.md file. This file contains the complete Claude Memory Bank system configuration and workflow instructions.

The CLAUDE.md file will explain:
- The Memory Bank system architecture

- How to track tasks and progress
- Project structure detection (single vs multi-project)

After reading CLAUDE.md, initialize the appropriate workflow.
