# Memory Bank: Initialization
<!-- Version: 2.1.0 -->

Read and follow the instructions in the BOOTSTRAP.md file. This file contains the complete Claude Memory Bank system configuration and workflow instructions.

Look for BOOTSTRAP.md in the .memory-bank directory (./.memory-bank/BOOTSTRAP.md)

The BOOTSTRAP.md file will explain:
- The Memory Bank system architecture
- Available workflow modes (@VAN, @PLAN, @IMPLEMENT, @REFLECT, @ASK)
- How to track tasks and progress
- Project structure detection (single vs multi-project)

After reading BOOTSTRAP.md, initialize the appropriate workflow.
