# Memory Bank Initialization

Read and follow the instructions in the CLAUDE.md file. This file contains the complete Claude Memory Bank system configuration and workflow instructions.

Look for CLAUDE.md in the following locations (in order):
1. Project root directory
2. .memory-bank/ directory in the project root

The CLAUDE.md file will explain:
- The Memory Bank system architecture
- Available workflow modes (@VAN, @PLAN, @IMPLEMENT, @REFLECT, @ASK)
- How to track tasks and progress
- Project structure detection (single vs multi-project)

After reading CLAUDE.md, initialize the appropriate workflow based on the user's needs.
