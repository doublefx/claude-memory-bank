# REFLECT MODE - VALIDATE & LEARN (HYBRID)

> **Version**: 2.1.0
> **Role**: Ensure quality and capture learnings for context evolution
>
> **Entry Command**: `@REFLECT`
>
> **Prerequisites**: IMPLEMENT mode completed

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

You are operating in REFLECT MODE - where implementation meets validation. Your responsibilities are:

1. **Quality Validation**: Verify implementation meets requirements
2. **Test Comprehensive**: Run full test suite
3. **Context Updates**: Update context files with learnings
4. **Pattern Capture**: Document new patterns discovered
5. **Success Documentation**: Record what worked well
6. **Improvement Areas**: Identify future enhancements

## PRE-FLIGHT VALIDATION (STEP 0 - MANDATORY)

### 0. Pre-flight Implementation Validation (MANDATORY - CANNOT SKIP)

```
‚ö†Ô∏è STOP! Before proceeding with ANY reflection, you MUST complete this validation:

1. Check .memory-bank/active/progress.md exists
2. Verify progress.md shows:
   - IMPLEMENT mode was entered
   - Implementation tasks were logged
   - No critical errors blocking reflection
3. Check .memory-bank/active/tasks.md for task status
4. Verify temp-files.md exists (if temporary files were created)
5. Confirm code changes were actually made:
   - Review git status or file modifications
   - Ensure implementation matches task requirements
6. If implementation NOT complete:
   - STOP immediately
   - Return to @IMPLEMENT mode to complete work
   - DO NOT proceed with reflection

‚õî BREAKING: Reflecting without implementation corrupts quality assurance
```

### 1. Reflection Mode Declaration (MANDATORY)

After pre-flight validation, you MUST output this EXACT format:

```yaml
REFLECT_MODE_VERIFICATION:
  timestamp: [ISO-8601 timestamp]
  implement_mode_completed: [true/false]
  progress_md_status:
    shows_implementation: [true/false]
    last_mode: [IMPLEMENT/other]
    tasks_completed: [count]
  temp_files_status:
    temp_files_md_exists: [true/false]
    entries_count: [number]
    cleanup_required: [true/false]
  code_changes_detected: [true/false]
  test_environment:
    test_command_available: [true/false]
    previous_test_results: [found/not_found]
  validation_result: [PROCEED/ABORT]
  reason: "[specific evidence for decision]"

PROCEEDING WITH REFLECTION / ABORTING - RETURNING TO IMPLEMENT MODE
```

**DO NOT CONTINUE** without this verification output.

## INPUTS TO READ

After successful pre-flight validation, review based on repository structure:

### Single-Project Repository:
1. **memory-bank/active/tasks.md** - Original requirements and plan
2. **memory-bank/active/progress.md** - Implementation journey
3. **memory-bank/context/** - All context files for updates
4. **memory-bank/decisions/log.md** - Validate design choices
5. **Code changes** - Review implementation quality

### Multi-Project Repository:
1. **memory-bank/[project-name]/active/tasks.md** - Project requirements
2. **memory-bank/[project-name]/active/progress.md** - Implementation journey
3. **memory-bank/[project-name]/context/** - Project context files
4. **memory-bank/shared/** - Check if updates benefit all projects
5. **memory-bank/[project-name]/decisions/log.md** - Design validation
6. **Code changes** - Review implementation in project directory

## REFLECTION PROCESS

### 0. Complete Pre-flight Validation (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
- Execute all pre-flight checks as specified above
- Output REFLECT_MODE_VERIFICATION yaml
- Abort if validation fails

### 1. Requirements Validation

Verify against original requirements:

```markdown
## Requirements Validation

### Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ [Requirement]: [How validated]
- ‚úÖ [Requirement]: [Test result]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Requirement]: [Partial - explanation]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [Metric vs target]
- Security: [Validation method]
- Usability: [Assessment]

### Success Criteria
- [Criteria 1]: ‚úÖ Met
- [Criteria 2]: ‚úÖ Exceeded
```

### 2. Test Execution

Run comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

Document results:
```markdown
## Test Results
- Unit Tests: X/Y passing
- Integration Tests: X/Y passing
- Coverage: X%
- Performance: [metrics]
```

### 3. Context File Updates

Review context files based on repository structure:

#### Single-Project Updates:
Update files in `memory-bank/context/`:
- **systemPatterns.md**: New patterns, validations, anti-patterns
- **techContext.md**: Dependencies, technical debt, performance
- **productContext.md**: User needs, feature impact, use cases
- **projectBrief.md**: Scope, constraints, goal alignment

#### Multi-Project Updates:
Consider both project and shared updates:

**Project-Specific** (`memory-bank/[project-name]/context/`):
- Patterns unique to this project
- Project-specific technical details
- Project user needs and features
- Project scope and constraints

**Shared Updates** (`memory-bank/shared/`):
- Patterns beneficial across projects
- Common conventions discovered
- Cross-project architecture insights
- Reusable components or utilities

**Decision Criteria for Shared**:
- Used by 2+ projects? ‚Üí shared/
- Solves common problem? ‚Üí shared/
- Improves consistency? ‚Üí shared/
- Project-specific only? ‚Üí project/context/

### 4. Learning Documentation

**File Location:**
- Single-Project: `memory-bank/qa/validation-results.md`
- Multi-Project: `memory-bank/[project-name]/qa/validation-results.md`

Create/update validation results:

```markdown
# Validation Results

## Summary
- **Feature**: [Name]
- **Date**: [Date]
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Success / ‚ö†Ô∏è Success with notes

## What Worked Well
### Process
- [Success]: [Why it worked]

### Technical
- [Pattern]: [Effectiveness]

### Design
- [Decision]: [Outcome]

## Areas for Improvement
### Challenges Faced
- [Challenge]: [Resolution]

### Lessons Learned
- [Insight]: [Application]

### Future Recommendations
- [Recommendation]: [Benefit]

## Context Updates Made
- systemPatterns.md: [What was added]
- techContext.md: [What was updated]
```

### 5. Quality Assessment

Evaluate code quality:

```
‚úÖ CODE QUALITY CHECK
- Follows established patterns
- Maintains consistency
- Proper error handling
- Adequate documentation
- No code smells

‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE CHECK
- Aligns with system design
- Scalable approach
- Maintainable structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
```

### 6. Archive Decision

Determine if archiving needed:

- **Level 1**: Usually no archive needed
- **Level 2**: Archive if significant learnings
- **Level 3**: Always archive for knowledge preservation

## OUTPUTS TO CREATE/UPDATE

### Single-Project:
1. **memory-bank/qa/validation-results.md** - Test results and learnings
2. **memory-bank/context/** - Updates based on discoveries
3. **memory-bank/active/progress.md** - Mark REFLECT complete
4. **memory-bank/decisions/log.md** - New architectural insights

### Multi-Project:
1. **memory-bank/[project-name]/qa/validation-results.md** - Project results
2. **memory-bank/[project-name]/context/** - Project-specific updates
3. **memory-bank/shared/** - Cross-project patterns and conventions
4. **memory-bank/[project-name]/active/progress.md** - Mark complete
5. **memory-bank/[project-name]/decisions/log.md** - Project decisions

**Important**: Always evaluate if learnings should be promoted to shared/

## üö® MANDATORY ACTIONS - DO NOT SKIP

Before exiting REFLECT mode, you MUST complete ALL of these:

```
‚õî CRITICAL: Skipping ANY of these steps will lose valuable learnings and leave artifacts
```

### Required Actions:

1. **Create/update validation-results.md** ‚úÖ MANDATORY:
   - Complete test results summary with metrics
   - Document what worked well (be specific)
   - Detail challenges encountered and resolutions
   - Capture lessons learned for future work
   - Include performance metrics if relevant
  
2. **Update ALL relevant context files** ‚úÖ MANDATORY:
   - systemPatterns.md: Add new patterns discovered

3. **Clean ALL temporary files** ‚úÖ MANDATORY:
   - Open temp-files.md and review EVERY entry
   - Delete all temporary test directories
   - Remove any backup files no longer needed
   - Clean up test data files
   - Remove debug logs
  
4. **Update temp-files.md** ‚úÖ MANDATORY:
   - Remove entries for ALL cleaned files
