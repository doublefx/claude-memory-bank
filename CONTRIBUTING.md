# Contributing to Claude Memory Bank

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Claude Memory Bank! This project maintains the original cursor-memory-bank methodology by @vanzan01 while adapting it for Claude Code.

## üéØ Core Principles

When contributing, please ensure that:

1. **Workflow Integrity**: All contributions must preserve 100% of the original cursor-memory-bank methodology
2. **Attribution**: Proper credit to @vanzan01 for the original methodology
3. **Claude Code Focus**: Enhancements should be specific to Claude Code capabilities
4. **File-Based System**: Maintain the file-based configuration approach

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/claude-memory-bank.git
   cd claude-memory-bank
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # For Python automation scripts
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x install.sh setup-memory-bank.sh
   
   # Test installation process
   bash install.sh --help
   bash setup-memory-bank.sh --help
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Test installation flow**:
   ```bash
   # Create test directory
   mkdir test-project && cd test-project
   
   # Run setup
   ../setup-memory-bank.sh
   
   # Verify structure
   ls -la .memory-bank/
   ```

2. **Test mode instructions**:
   - Verify all 6 mode instruction files are complete
   - Check that workflow routing is preserved
   - Ensure BOOTSTRAP.md configuration is comprehensive

3. **Test automation scripts**:
   ```bash
   python .memory-bank/scripts/auto-update.py --help
   ```
