# Claude Memory Bank - System Starter v2.0

> **Memory Bank System v2.0** - Generic Context-Driven Workflow  
> Supports both single-project and multi-project repositories  
> Original methodology by @vanzan01, enhanced for flexible project structures

## Quick Start

Copy this message to Claude Code to initialize the Memory Bank system:

```
I want to use the Claude Memory Bank system v2.0. Please read the CLAUDE.md configuration file and all mode instructions from .memory-bank/custom_modes/ to understand the context-driven workflow.

The system supports both single-project and multi-project repositories. It will automatically detect the structure and adapt its behavior. The system uses 4 modes (VAN, PLAN, IMPLEMENT, REFLECT) with context files as the foundation.

For multi-project repos: The system will scan for active tasks across all projects and help me choose which to continue or start new work.

Start with @VAN mode to detect project structure, create/update context files, and assess task complexity.
```

## System Overview

The hybrid Memory Bank system prioritizes context understanding while maintaining structured workflow:

        PB --> SP[🏗️ systemPatterns.md]
        PB --> TC[⚙️ techContext.md]
    end

        VAN --> IMPLEMENT[⚒️ IMPLEMENT]

    end
    
    PC --> AC[💡 activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
```

## Core Philosophy

1. **Context First**: All work begins with understanding through context files
2. **Adaptive Workflow**: Only use modes that add value (3 complexity levels)
3. **Living Documentation**: Context evolves with each task
4. **Minimal Ceremony**: Streamlined from 6 to 4 modes

## Mode Commands

### Primary Workflow
- `@VAN` - **Initialize & Assess** (Always first - creates/updates context)
- `@PLAN` - **Strategy & Design** (Level 2-3 tasks)
- `@IMPLEMENT` - **Build & Test** (Execute with context awareness)
- `@REFLECT` - **Validate & Learn** (Update context with insights)

### Context Files Created by VAN
- **projectBrief.md** - Project overview, goals, constraints
- **productContext.md** - User needs, features, business value
- **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture, conventions, patterns
- **techContext.md** - Stack, dependencies, technical details

## Complexity Routing

### Level 1: Quick Fix (< 1 hour)
```
@VAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT
```
Simple fixes using existing context

### Level 2: Feature/Enhancement (1 hour - 1 day)
```
@VAN → @PLAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT
```
Clear requirements with some design decisions

### Level 3: Complex Feature (1+ days)
```
@VAN → @PLAN (with design) → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT
```
Multiple components, significant design decisions

## Key Benefits

### Over Pure Task-Based Approach
- Context persists across tasks
- Better architectural decisions
- Faster onboarding for new work
- Patterns emerge and evolve

### Over Pure Context-Only Approach
- Structured workflow ensures quality
- Progress tracking built-in
- Design decisions documented
- Validation phase included

## Project Structure Support

The Memory Bank system automatically adapts to your repository type:

### Single-Project Repository
```
.memory-bank/
├── context/                 # Foundation files
│   ├── projectBrief.md     # Created/updated by VAN
│   ├── productContext.md   # Business perspective
│   ├── systemPatterns.md   # Technical patterns
│   └── techContext.md      # Implementation details
├── active/                  # Current work
│   ├── activeContext.md    # Synthesized context
│   ├── tasks.md           # Task breakdown
│   └── progress.md        # Progress tracking
├── technical/              # Deep implementation docs
├── decisions/              # Design decisions
│   └── log.md             # Decision history
└── qa/                     # Quality assurance
    └── validation-results.md # From REFLECT mode
```

### Multi-Project Repository
```
.memory-bank/
├── shared/                 # Cross-project resources
│   ├── patterns.md        # Reusable patterns
│   └── conventions.md     # Global standards
├── api-service/           # Each project has full structure
│   ├── context/
│   ├── active/
│   ├── technical/
│   ├── decisions/
│   └── qa/
├── web-app/
│   └── [same structure]
└── mobile-app/
    └── [same structure]
```

**Key Differences**:
- Single: All files in root .memory-bank/
- Multi: Each project isolated, shared patterns centralized
- Multi: VAN mode scans all projects for active tasks

## Example Usage

### Single-Project Repository

```
User: I need to add error tracking to the pipeline viewer

Claude: I'll use the Memory Bank system to help with this. Let me start with @VAN mode.

@VAN
[Detects single-project structure, reads context files]

This is a single-project repository. Based on the context, adding error tracking is a Level 2 enhancement. The system already has error handling patterns in systemPatterns.md that we'll extend.

Next mode: @PLAN
```

### Multi-Project Repository

```
User: I need to work on the authentication feature

Claude: Let me check your Memory Bank structure with @VAN mode.

@VAN
[Detects multi-project structure, scans all projects]

I've detected this is a multi-project repository with:
- api-service (has active Level 2 task: "Add rate limiting")
- web-app (no active tasks)
- auth-service (has active Level 3 task: "Implement OAuth2")

Would you like to:
1. Continue the auth-service OAuth2 task
2. Continue the api-service rate limiting task
3. Start a new authentication task

User: Continue with OAuth2

Claude: Loading auth-service context and resuming OAuth2 implementation...
[Continues with appropriate workflow mode]
```

## Tips for Success

### General Tips
1. **Trust the Context**: Let context files guide decisions
2. **Update Continuously**: Keep context current as you learn
3. **Use Appropriate Modes**: Skip PLAN for Level 1 tasks
4. **Document Patterns**: Capture reusable patterns in REFLECT
5. **Synthesize Actively**: activeContext.md connects context to current work

### Multi-Project Tips
6. **Use Shared Wisely**: Promote patterns to shared/ when they benefit multiple projects
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Each project's context remains independent
8. **Cross-Project Learning**: REFLECT mode can suggest patterns for shared/
9. **Active Task Awareness**: VAN always shows what's in progress across projects
10. **Consistent Conventions**: Follow shared/conventions.md across all projects

## Common Scenarios

### Bug Fix (Level 1)
- VAN reads context, identifies fix location
- Skip PLAN, go directly to IMPLEMENT
- REFLECT validates fix and updates techContext if needed

### New Feature (Level 2)
- VAN updates productContext with new feature
- PLAN creates strategy using existing patterns
- IMPLEMENT builds following plan
- REFLECT captures new patterns

### Architecture Change (Level 3)
- VAN comprehensively updates all context files
- PLAN includes design exploration
- IMPLEMENT follows design decisions
- REFLECT updates architecture patterns

## Getting Started

### Setup Options
